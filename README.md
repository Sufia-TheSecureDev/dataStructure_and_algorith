DSA implementation with php 

### Linked List
  - Node represantation
  - dummy node insertion
  - single node insertion at tail
  - bulk insertion at tail
  - insertion at head
  - insertion at any position
  - node traversing by printing  
  - delete from any position
  - revese a linked list

### Counting sort
 - a given string sorted using counting sort  [Time complexity :  O(n) ]

### Bubble sort
 - an integer array sorted using buble sort [Time complexity :  O(n^2) ]

### Insertion sort
 - an integer array sorted using Insertion sort [Time complexity :  O(n^2) but better than bubble sort because this algo skip swaping process ]
